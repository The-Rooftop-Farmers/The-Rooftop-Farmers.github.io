                        An automated rooftop farming robot designed and built by The Rooftop Farmers. It sows seeds,
                        waters plants, and monitors environmental conditions with sensors. Powered by Arduino and
                        stepper motors, it demonstrates how urban spaces can be converted into efficient, smart farms.
